# Working With Ruby Classes

## Learning Goals

- Interpret unfamiliar code
- Analyze instance methods that relate multiple `Class`es

## Instructions

In this lab, we will be practice reading object-oriented code. In the `lib`
folder, there are a number of existing, related Ruby `Class`es. Your task is to
read through the code, then use your understanding of it to fill in the methods
in `answers.rb`.

Run `learn` to see your progress.
